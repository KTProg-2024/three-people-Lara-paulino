     <h2> Coco Chanel (1883 - 1971)</h2>

     <p class="cocointro">"From science to one of the most iconic brands in the fashion world - Coco Chanel was a woman who changed the face of fashion forever". &copy; <a href= "https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/42872803">BBC</a> </p>
   
     <p> Coco seemed to be a very independent woman, with a clear image of where she wanted to be. I admire that in her. </p>

     <h2> Malala Yousafzai (1997 - present day)</h2>

     <p class="malalaintro">"Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani advocate for girls education and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. In 2009, when Malala was just 11 years old, she began blogging about life under the Taliban, speaking out directly against their threats to close girls’ schools". &copy;<a href= "https://www.one.org/us/blog/12-women-who-changed-the-world/">ONE</a></p>

     <p>Malala's fight for girls education is truly inspirational. I think she is very brave for speaking out, though she was constantly receiving death threats.</p>

     <h2> Dr. Mae Jemison </h2>

     <p class="maeintro">"Dr. Mae Jemison, an American physician, is the first African American female astronaut. She was accepted to NASA’s astronaut training program in 1987. Five years later, she became the first African American woman in space as a science mission specialist aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Before her career at NASA, she worked in a Cambodian refugee camp in Thailand and served in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone and Liberia". &copy; <a href="https://www.one.org/us/blog/12-women-who-changed-the-world/">ONE</a></p>

     <p> I see Dr. Mae Jemison as someone who believes in herself.  She believed that she could achieve her dream, so she did.</p>
